# Description
Learn how to build node applications with the application programming model on SAP Cloud Platform.

## Scenario:

SPICY (Space Itinerary Company) is the most popular travel technology company in our milky way. Owing to the increasing demand in space travel, SPICY is now building a website where it offers users from all planets to login and book their next space flight. You, as a part of the software engineering team of SPICY, have chosen SAP Cloud Platform to build this website.

### [Exercise 01: Create a new Business Application using local development tools](./-exercises-/exercise01/README.md)
In this exercise, we will learn to set up our local development environment and create a new node.js project. This will be our codebase to create the Space travel web application.

### [Exercise 02: Understand and extend the data model](./-exercises-/exercise02/README.md)
In this exercise, we will understand the data model of the [base space-flight project](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight). Using the base model, we create tables in a local SQLite database and load data from CSV files. We will further extend the data model to include payment information for space travel bookings.

### [Exercise 03: Add custom logic restricting the number of travellers in a spacecraft](./-exercises-/exercise03/README.md)
In this exercise, we will learn to expose our data model entities as OData services. We will also include custom logic to limit the number of passengers in each space craft. 

### [Exercise 04: Build a User Interface using SAP UI5 from SAP Web IDE](./-exercises-/exercise04/README.md)
In this exercise, we will import the code into SAP Web IDE and build a User Interface based on SAP UI5 so that users can create a booking from the UI of our app.

### [Exercise 05: Deploy the application to SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment](./-exercises-/exercise05/README.md)
In this exercise, we will deploy the application to SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment. The multiple components of the app are visualized and monitored from SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit.

## Requirements

### For SAP TechEd 2018
SAP TechEd will provide you with a full environment to develop this sample application. The instructions below are only needed if you wish to run the application in your own account on SAP Cloud Platform.

### Development in SAP Cloud Platform Web IDE

SAP Web IDE Full-Stack access is needed. For more information, see [Open SAP Web IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/51321a804b1a4935b0ab7255447f5f84.html).

Read the [getting started tutorial](https://help.sap.com/viewer//65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/5ec8c983a0bf43b4a13186fcf59015fc.html) to learn more about working with SAP Cloud Platform Web IDE.

A **HANA instance** is needed in your account, so that you can deploy the persistence assets.

Now clone your fork of this repository (*File -> Git -> Clone Repository*).

#### Develop, Build, Deploy

To build and deploy your application or modify it and redeploy, use any of the following options:

* Build and deploy the DB module by choosing *Build* from the context menu of the db folder.

* Build and deploy the Node.js service by choosing *Run -> Run as -> Node.js application* from the context menu of the srv folder. To test the service, click the URL displayed in the Run Console. Use the endpoint of the service *clouds.products.CatalogService* to call $metadata or CRUD requests.

* Test the UI by choosing *Run -> Run as -> Web Application* from the context menu of the ui folder.

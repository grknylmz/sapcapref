# Exercise 02 - Use the Fiori Tools to create a Fiori app

In this exercise, you'll create a Fiori Elements web app based on the OData endpoint, which is accessed via the Destination you created earlier. You'll customize the List Report page and add a new Object page with annotations to get a glimpse of the Fiori Tools' full power.

Avoid to copy and paste the snippets and **make use of the autocomplete feature** of the SAP Business Application Studio instead.

#### Step 4
You'll see an additional input field "Choose your project folder" on this screen. Keep the default value here.

#### Step 5
Here the browser won't open up automatically (because you are already using it). Instead, you'll see a blue popup in the bottom-left corner. Click on **Open in New Tab** to get to the running web app. If prompted, accept all ports that the SAP Business Application Studio needs to open.

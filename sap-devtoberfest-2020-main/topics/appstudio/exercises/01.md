# Exercise 01 - Set the development environment up


> Before you start, please be aware that completing this exercise relies on the hardware and software  [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md).

In this exercise, you'll create a destination for the ES5 demo system. This destination is the bridge connecting the backend system with the application we are building during the following exercises.

Additionally, you'll create a dev space in SAP Business Application Studio. Each dev space kind comes with a variable set of installed tools that will support your development activities. As all dev spaces are completely isolated environments, you have a terminal with full root access to install additional tools and editor plugins.

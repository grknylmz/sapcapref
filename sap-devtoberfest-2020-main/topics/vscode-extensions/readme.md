# Building VSCode Extensions

**This enablement content is part Devtoberfest Week 6 : Sep 28 - Oct 2.**

As we have seen over several weeks of sessions, the vast majority of the development experience is delivered via the Business Application Studio and/or VSCode.  The two have a close relationship sharing similar architecture, design and importantly the same approach to extensions.  This is how SAP is now able to develop new editors and development tools and deliver them to both Busienss Application Studio and VSCode.

In this topic's sessions we will look at how a VSCode extension is developed and how you can begin to create your own extensions.

All of the scheduled content described on this page is available in a [public Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Ym1ibGJucHFkOHMwcWZoYnZnMjJqazE3OWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) so that you can bring the events into your own calendar and get reminders for each of them. Alternatively, if you're subscribed to the [SAP Developers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sapdevs) you can get reminder notifications for individual live stream and premiere videos.
